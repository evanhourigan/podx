# PodX TUI Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan covers all interactive TUI commands to verify:
- Clean terminal output (no Rich panels/headers before/after TUI)
- Proper navigation (Esc to go back, Enter to continue)
- Cancellation messages
- Completion messages with detailed information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred Features (Not Yet Implemented)
The following features are **NOT** currently implemented but have infrastructure ready:
- **Test 7**: Selection preservation (requires architectural change)
- **Test 8**: ExecutionTUI progress tracking (requires refactoring)

These are clearly marked in their respective test sections below.

---

## Test 1: `podx run` - Main Pipeline with TUI

### Test 1.1: Full Pipeline Flow with Episode Selection
```bash
podx run
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ‚úÖ TUI launches immediately (no Rich panels/headers in terminal)
2. ‚úÖ Episode browser shows with list of episodes
3. ‚úÖ Footer shows: `Enter Continue  Esc Cancel`
4. ‚úÖ Select an episode and press Enter
5. ‚úÖ Config modal appears (titled "Pipeline Settings")
6. ‚úÖ Modal text: "Select the settings for the pipeline"
7. ‚úÖ Footer shows: `Enter Continue  Esc Cancel`
8. ‚úÖ Configure options and press Enter
9. ‚úÖ TUI exits cleanly back to terminal
10. ‚úÖ Terminal shows clean progress output (no Rich panels)
11. ‚úÖ Progress messages like: `‚úÖ Audio transcoded to wav16 (0:01)`
12. ‚úÖ When complete, shows detailed completion message:
    ```
    ‚úÖ Pipeline completed in X.Xs
       Show: {show} ‚Ä¢ Title: {title} ‚Ä¢ Date: {date}
       Steps: fetch ‚Üí transcode ‚Üí transcribe ‚Üí ...
       üìÑ Transcript: {path}
       ü§ñ Analysis: {path}
    ```

3. Press Esc
4. ‚úÖ Returns to episode browser (NOT exit)
5. ‚úÖ Previously selected episode is still highlighted

## Test 6: Terminal Corruption Prevention

### Test 6.1: Rapid Cancellation

# Immediately press Esc when TUI appears
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. TUI exits cleanly
2. Terminal prompt works normally (not corrupted)
3. Run `reset` to verify terminal is clean

```bash
podx run
# Press Ctrl+C while in TUI
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. TUI exits
2. Terminal returns to normal state
3. Run `reset` if needed to verify

---

## Test 7: Selection Preservation

**STATUS: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

This requires architectural changes to show ConfigPanel as a modal WITHIN EpisodeBrowserTUI (instead of separate apps).

**Current behavior:**
- Episode browser exits when you press Enter
- ConfigPanel launches as separate app
- Pressing Esc in config shows cancellation message and exits
- Cannot navigate back to episode list

**When implemented:**
- ConfigPanel will be a modal within episode browser
- Esc will dismiss modal and return to episode list with cursor preserved
- Can re-enter config or select different episode

---

## Test 8: ExecutionTUI Progress Tracking

**STATUS: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

ExecutionTUI infrastructure exists but is not integrated with the pipeline orchestrator. This is a deferred enhancement (estimated 4-6 hours of refactoring).

**When implemented, it will:**
- Show live progress in TUI during pipeline execution
- Display progress bar with current step
- Show execution log with timestamps
- Support --verbose mode for detailed logging

**Current behavior:** After config, TUI exits and progress shows in terminal.

---

## Test 9: No Rich Output Verification

### Test 9.1: Check All Commands
For each command, verify NO Rich panels/headers appear:

```bash
podx run                           # Should go straight to TUI
podx-preprocess --interactive      # Should go straight to TUI
podx-diarize --interactive         # Should go straight to TUI
podx-deepcast --interactive        # Should go straight to TUI
podx-notion --interactive          # Should show plain table
```

**Expected:**
- No decorative boxes/panels before TUI
- No "PodX" header with version
- No Rich-formatted confirmation prompts

---

## Test 10: Edge Cases

### Test 10.1: Empty Episode Directory
```bash
cd /tmp/empty_dir
podx run
```

**Expected:**
- TUI shows "No episodes found" message gracefully

### Test 10.2: No Deepcast Files for Notion
```bash
cd /tmp/no_deepcast
podx-notion --interactive
```

**Expected:**
```
‚ùå No deepcast files found in /tmp/no_deepcast
```

### Test 10.3: Invalid Selection
```bash
podx run
# Select episode
# In config, enter invalid values
```

**Expected:**
- Validation errors shown clearly
- Can correct and continue

---

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with:
- ‚úÖ Clean TUI launch (no Rich output)
- ‚úÖ Proper navigation (Esc goes back on nested screens)
- ‚úÖ Clear cancellation messages with ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ Detailed completion messages with ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ No terminal corruption
- ‚úÖ Selection preservation when navigating back
- ‚úÖ Live progress updates in ExecutionTUI
- ‚úÖ All emoji-based terminal messages display correctly

---

## Notes

- Test in a clean terminal session
- Run `reset` between tests if terminal gets corrupted
- Verify all completion messages include relevant paths/info
- Check that Esc behavior is consistent (back vs cancel)
- Ensure Enter is always shown in footer with action label
