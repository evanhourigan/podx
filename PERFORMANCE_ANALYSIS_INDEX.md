## How to Use This Analysis

### For Pull Request Authors:
1. Start with PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.txt for context
2. Refer to specific sections in PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md for implementation details
3. Use code examples from Section 9 as templates
4. Run profiling commands from Section 10 to validate improvements

### For Code Reviewers:
1. Check against optimization roadmap (PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.txt)
2. Verify async implementation follows semaphore pattern
3. Validate file I/O caching doesn't break on concurrent access
4. Ensure LLM batching respects rate limits

### For Architecture Decisions:
1. Consider orjson adoption for JSON library migration
2. Plan async infrastructure expansion for future optimizations
3. Design session-scoped caching layer for artifact discovery

## Validation

All findings are based on:
- Source code static analysis of 70+ Python files
- 179 identified json.loads()/json.dumps() operations
- 52 subprocess.run() patterns
- 60 file system scan operations
- Code complexity analysis of core algorithms
- Identified unused optimization infrastructure (async services, model cache)

To validate:
```bash
# Run the profiling recommendations from Section 10
python -m cProfile -s cumulative podx-deepcast --input sample.json --output out.json
python -m cProfile -s cumulative podx export --interactive --scan-dir /path/to/episodes
```
