# Session 2: TUI Bug Fixes and Podcast Search Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-10-26

## Overview
This session focused on fixing critical bugs in the TUI preprocessing modal and enhancing the podcast fetch command to handle multiple search results.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Preprocessing Modal - Rich Markup Error
**Problem:** Preprocessing modal crashed with `MarkupError: closing tag '[/]' at position 14 has nothing to close`

**Root Cause:** Improper Rich markup closing tags in `PreprocessConfigModal._make_option_widget()` and `_refresh_option()`

**Fix:** Changed from generic `[/]` to proper closing tags:
- `[.option-key]text[/]` → `[.option-key]text[/.option-key]`
- Applied to all markup tags in the modal

**Files Modified:**
- `podx/ui/preprocess_browser.py` (lines 117, 131)

### 2. Fetch Command - Wrong Podcast Selection
**Problem:** When searching "Lenny's Podcast", iTunes API returned 49 results but code took first match (wrong podcast - crypto podcast with 3 episodes from 2022)

**Root Cause:** `find_feed_for_show()` always selected `results[0]` without user confirmation

**Solution:** Implemented two-phase podcast selection:
1. **Phase 1:** Show all matching podcasts in a table (Podcast | Author | Episodes)
2. **Phase 2:** After user selects correct podcast, show episodes

**Implementation:**
- Created `search_podcasts()` function to return all iTunes results
- Added podcast selection table to `FetchModal`
- Added `_show_podcast_selection()` to display podcast results
- Added `_update_podcast_detail()` for podcast info in detail panel
- Added event handlers for podcast table interaction

**Files Modified:**
- `podx/fetch.py` (lines 40-104: new `search_podcasts()`, refactored `find_feed_for_show()`)
- `podx/ui/episode_browser_tui.py`:
  - Added podcast table container and CSS
  - Added `_show_podcast_selection()` method
  - Added `_update_podcast_detail()` method
  - Added podcast table event handlers
  - Modified `search_and_load()` to show podcast selection when multiple results

### 3. Fetch Modal - Threading Error
**Problem:** After selecting podcast, app crashed with: `RuntimeError: The call_from_thread method must run in a different thread from the app`

**Root Cause 1:** `on_podcast_row_selected()` called `_parse_feed_episodes(feed_url)` directly from event handler (main thread), but that method uses `call_from_thread()`

**Fix 1:** Changed to call `load_episodes_from_url(feed_url)` which runs in worker thread

**Root Cause 2:** In `StandaloneFetchBrowser.open_fetch_modal()`, `modal.search_and_load()` was called BEFORE modal was mounted, so app context wasn't initialized

**Fix 2:** Moved automatic search trigger to modal's `on_mount()` method, ensuring modal is fully mounted before worker threads start

**Files Modified:**
- `podx/ui/episode_browser_tui.py`:
  - Line 452: Changed direct call to worker method
  - Lines 147-149: Added automatic search trigger in `on_mount()`
  - Line 1059: Removed premature search call

### 4. Interactive Fetch - Validation Error
**Problem:** `podx-fetch --interactive` returned `None` causing validation error: `Invalid output for EpisodeMeta: Input should be a valid dictionary`

**Root Cause:** `StandaloneFetchBrowser` returned just `meta` dict, but `fetch.py` expected dict with `"meta"`, `"meta_path"`, `"directory"`, `"date"` keys

**Fix:** Modified `open_fetch_modal()` to construct full result dict with all required fields

**Files Modified:**
- `podx/ui/episode_browser_tui.py` (lines 915-922)

## Technical Details

### Worker Thread Pattern
Textual requires background operations to run in worker threads when they need to update the UI via `call_from_thread()`:

```python
@work(exclusive=True, thread=True)
def background_operation(self):
    # Heavy work here
    self.app.call_from_thread(self._update_ui_method)
```

Event handlers run in main thread and cannot use `call_from_thread()` directly.

### Modal Lifecycle
1. Modal created
2. Modal pushed to screen (`push_screen_wait()`)
3. Modal mounted (`on_mount()` called) ← App context ready for workers
4. User interaction
5. Modal dismissed with result

### Rich Markup Syntax
Proper closing tags must match opening tags:
- Class-based: `[.classname]text[/.classname]`
- Style-based: `[dim]text[/dim]`
- Generic `[/]` doesn't work with class-based tags

## Files Modified Summary

1. **podx/fetch.py**
   - Added `search_podcasts()` function
   - Refactored `find_feed_for_show()` to use `search_podcasts()`

2. **podx/ui/episode_browser_tui.py**
   - Fixed threading issues with worker decorators
   - Added podcast selection table and related methods
   - Fixed modal initialization timing
   - Fixed result format for fetch command

3. **podx/ui/preprocess_browser.py**
   - Fixed Rich markup syntax errors

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ `podx-preprocess --interactive` - Modal displays without markup errors
2. ✅ `podx-fetch --interactive` - Searches and shows multiple podcasts
3. ✅ Podcast selection - Loads episodes without threading errors
4. ✅ Episode fetch - Returns proper metadata format

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Search "Lenny's Podcast" → Got wrong podcast (crypto) automatically
- No way to choose correct podcast from 49 results
- Various crashes with markup and threading errors

### After
- Search "Lenny's Podcast" → See all 49 matching podcasts in table
- Select correct podcast: "Lenny's Podcast: Product | Career | Growth" by Lenny Rachitsky
- Episodes load smoothly with latest 2025 content
- All TUI interactions work without crashes

## Next Steps
- Continue TUI testing per TUI_TEST_PLAN.md
- Test preprocessing modal toggle functionality
- Verify all interactive commands work end-to-end
